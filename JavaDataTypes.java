/*

Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int , long, float and double. For this exercise,
we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int and long):

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
A int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.

Input Format: The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case, T, is comprised of a single line with an integer, n, which can be arbitrarily larger
or small.
Output Format: For each input variable n and appropriate primitive dataType, you must determine if the
given primitives are capable of storing it. If yes, the print.

If there is more than one appropriate type, print each one on its own line and order them by size.(i.e. 
byte <short<int<long.

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitive print the line.
